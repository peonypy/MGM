MGM is a health care application utilized as a real-time lifeline connection
between people and Social Service departments. The application provides custom Client surveys and forms,
contact management, emotional polling/questionnaires backed by reporting and analysis, backend role
administration, goal management, file management, and a geo-fenced based activity tracking that ensures
client safety while retaining user privacy.
